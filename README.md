# Speech Emotion Recognition Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on recognizing emotions from spoken language using advanced machine learning techniques. It leverages audio signal processing and deep learning models to analyze vocal patterns and identify underlying emotions, aiming to bridge communication gaps in human-computer interaction.

## Features
- **Emotion Detection**: Identify various emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutrality from speech.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes state-of-the-art models to ensure high accuracy in emotion recognition.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Designed to recognize emotions through English.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Librosa for audio signal processing
- TensorFlow/Keras for building and training deep learning models

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip package manager

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-emotion-recognition.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd speech-emotion-recognition
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. To start the emotion recognition process on a pre-recorded audio file:
   ```
   upload the new file and run the script
   ```


## How It Works
The project pipeline consists of several key steps:
1. **Preprocessing**: Converts audio input into a spectrogram for analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction**: capture the audio signal's characteristics.
3. **Model Training**: Trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a labeled dataset of various emotional speech samples.
4. **Emotion Prediction**: The trained model predicts the emotion of new audio inputs.
